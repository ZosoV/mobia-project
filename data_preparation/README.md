# Data Preparation

In this folder, we developed some script to perform different data preparation 
task (resize, organize in folder, divide data, label data, among others).

* The [./detection](./detection/) folder encloses some scripts to prepare the 
data for dectection models: `tcnet` and `lpdnet`.

* The [./character_recognition](./character_recognition/) folder encloses scripts
to prepare data for character recognition models: `lprnet`.

* We aim to add another folder [./color_classification](.color_classification)
for enclosing script to prepare data for `colornet`, but it will only happend
if we need to update this model.
